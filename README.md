# Pomodoro Timer

## Overview

The Pomodoro Timer is a React application that implements a Pomodoro timer with features such as start, pause, reset, increase, and decrease. It also tracks work intervals and breaks completed.

## Features

- **Start**: Begins the Pomodoro timer.
- **Pause**: Pauses the timer.
- **Reset**: Resets the timer to the default 25 minutes.
- **Increase/Decrease**: Adjusts the timer's duration.
- **Break**: Automatically switches to a break after the Pomodoro timer ends and vice versa.

### Workflow Configuration

The GitHub Actions workflow performs the following steps:

- Checks out the code from the repository.
- Sets up the Node.js environment.
- Installs dependencies.
- Runs the tests with `npm test`.
